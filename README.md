# Overview
Having to use an API and making ```HTTP REQUESTS``` can be a bit of a task.
Instead of making these `HTTP` calls, this SDK is being built to wrap all endpoints into simple functions.

Provided you have a valid token signed and gotten from [Micro Api - Comments Microservice](https://comment.microapi.dev) you can easily make use of the comments microservice via writing simple functions.

Don't worry about `HTTP Requests`, we got you!!
